# Accelerometers Dataset Script

The R script [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) creates a dataset of the
mean and standard deviation measurements from the accelerometers from
the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The dataset is stored in the variable data.

The script also creates a dataset containing the average of each measurement
for each activity and subject. This dataset is stored in the variable meandt.
This dataset is also saved to the R working directory in a file named
accelerometers-mean.txt.

Reference [codebook.md](codebook.md) for information on the variables in the
dataset.
